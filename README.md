# game-project: Treasure Hunt

This is a game with an Octopus which searches for and catches treasures. 
The game gives the player a limited time to reach and capture all the treasures.
The challenge did not allow us to use canvas. Therefore, creating a "canvas" container that limits all movements was a significant challenge.

Next:
-Activate the restart button 
-Create obstacles that take lives away
-Create levels
